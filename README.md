Eclipse Shield is the implementation of an off-grid Meshtastic node to be installed atop the Haley Center, aiming to increase coverage for the greater Auburn-Opelika area. The project focuses on providing an educational gateway project for engineering students (or related fields) to build a node of their own and gain experience with microcontrollers, RF, open-source software (OSS) and hardware design, and 3D printing.

Overview: What Is Meshtastic?
[Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/docs/introduction/) is an open-source, decentralized communication system that uses LoRa (Long Range) radio technology to enable encrypted, low-power digital messaging between devices known as nodes. Nodes can take several forms, including handheld devices with integrated displays, compact Bluetooth-enabled units that interface with smartphones, or permanently installed high-power stations designed for wide-area coverage. Meshtastic is commonly used by hobbyists, outdoor enthusiasts operating beyond cellular coverage, and for emergency or resilient communications during network outages. Its decentralized architecture and low cost make it well suited as an educational platform for students.
